# Stain-detection-in-fabrics
# This is a MATLAB code for stain detection in fabrics
Read the image of the fabric which containsthe stain.Then convert the rbg(red blue green) image into grey scale image. If its already in grey scale then no need to convert into grey scale.Next step is to perform image enhancement by thresholding technques.Histogram equalization method is adopted to enhance the contrast of the fabric surface.Histogram Equalization algorithm works good in this case as the fabric texture.Then perform defect identification and texture analysis using K-Means clustering.
